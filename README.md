# Spatial Pixel Code

This repository hosts code featured at [Spatial Pixel](http://spatialpixel.com).

The code is organized loosely by topic, where top-level folders indicate the area the
contained sketches demonstrate, and those sometimes have subtopics, like 'Biomimicry.'

## Languages

These sketches are currently written in Python and [Processing](http://processing.org) 3+, in both the Python and Java modes.

## Processing Libraries

The folder in the repo called `libraries` contains descriptions of where to download the
Processing library referenced, so you can download them and copy them into your
sketchbook's `libraries` folder.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repo and send a pull request with
a nice commit message. Screenshots are great. :)
