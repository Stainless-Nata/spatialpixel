# Spatial Pixel Code

This repository hosts the code featured on [Spatial Pixel](http://spatialpixel.com) and will 
comprise material in upcoming courses and books on _Design Computation_ and 
_Programming with Processing_.

The code is organized by topic, where top-level folders indicate the area the contained sketches 
demonstrate, and those sometimes have subtopics, like 'Biomimicry.' A good deal of this code was presented

## Languages

These sketches are currently written in the Java-based mode of [Processing](http://processing.org)
and should work with version 2.1+. Future plans include porting those sketches to Processing.js, and including more written in Ruby, Python, and Javascript.

## Required Libraries

Library management in Processing is still a bit awkward. The folder in the repo called 
`libraries` contains descriptions of where to download the library referenced, so you can 
download them and copy them into your sketchbook's `libraries` folder.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repo and send a pull request with 
a nice commit message. Screenshots are great. Try to fit the naming convention. :)
