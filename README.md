# Spatial Pixel Code

This repository hosts libraries and code featured at [Spatial Pixel](http://spatialpixel.com),
consisting of functionality for computational designers.

These sketches are written in Python and [Processing](http://processing.org) 3+, in both the Python and Java modes.

## Using These Libraries

_More to come..._

1. First, download a modified version of Python Mode for Processing that provides Python library support.
2. Create a `libraries_python` folder in your sketchbook.
3. Clone this repo into a new subfolder of that folder.

    $ cd libraries_python
    $ git clone https://github.com/awmartin/spatialpixel

The structure should look like this:

    YOUR SKETCHBOOK/
      |- ...
      |
      |- libraries/
      |- libraries_python/
      |   |- spatialpixel/
      |- modes/
      |   |- PythonMode
      |
      |- ...

Start Processing in Python Mode and you should be good to go.
