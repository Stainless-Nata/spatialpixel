# Cellular Mitosis Simulation with Environmental Interaction

In this simulation, growth is determined by the availablility of "food" in the environment around
the cells. While there is no formal abstraction for "environment" yet, the food itself is modeled
as an array of numbers. Cells eat and reproduce if they eat enough, and then die if they starve.
